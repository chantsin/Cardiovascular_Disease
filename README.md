# Cardiovascular Disease Project

Exploratory analysis of cardiovascular disease data set from Kaggle. 

## Description

The objective of this project is to analyse what trends and patterns do people with a cardiovascular disease bring versus people without. This can be informative for the general public to be aware of signs that they should have a checkup with their doctors if these signs show. 

The project uses data from a Kaggle source and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/code?datasetId=107706&sortBy=voteCount). 

In this project we look at different types of comparisons between the variables provided in the data and analyse to see what is present in people with a CVD as opposed to people without. We go through analyses such as a correlational analysis, gender, age, and body mass index.
